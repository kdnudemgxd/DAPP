# DAPP
## Project description 
Dynamic path planning method based on the Adaptive replanning Period and conflict-free Path length (DAPP) is an efficient path planning method. It is a parameter estimation-based dynamic path planning framework that revolves around the core idea of leveraging the actual operation time of the physical system to enhance path planning efficiency.
## Installation
- The codes in RHCR_C++, which are C++ codes, are from https://github.com/Jiaoyang-Li/RHCR, and we have modified a section of the code to use it as the PBS solver. The main function is located in driver.cpp. These codes need to be executed within the Visual Studio environment.
- Other MATLAB codes are written in MATLAB 2020a. The main function is DAPP.m.
## Usage
- First, run the driver.cpp file in Visual Studio.
- Then, run the DAPP.m file in MATLAB.
